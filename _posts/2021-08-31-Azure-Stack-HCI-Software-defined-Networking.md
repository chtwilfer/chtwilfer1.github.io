## **Azure Stack HCI  - Software defined Networking**

Software defined Networking (SDN) virtualizes your network to abstract physical hardware network elements such as switches and routers. Using SDN you can dynamically manage your datacenter networking to meet workload and app requirements. Network policies can be implemented consistently, at scale, even as you deploy new workloads, or move workloads across virtual or physical networks.

With **SDN** you deploy virtual appliances in your **Azure Stack HCI** Environment. A virtual appliance is dynamic and easy to change because it is a pre-built, customized virtual machine. It can be one or more virtual machines packaged, updated, and maintained as a unit. Together with software defined networking (SDN), you get the agility and flexibility needed in today's cloud-based infrastructure. 

For example:
- SDN presents the network as a pooled and dynamic resource
- SDN facilitates tenant isolation.
- SDN maximizes scale and performance.
- Virtual appliances enable seamless capacity expansion and workload mobility.
- Virtual appliances minimize operational complexity.
- Virtual appliances let customers easily acquire, deploy, and manage pre-integrated solutions.
- Customers can easily move the virtual appliance anywhere in the cloud.
- Customers can scale virtual appliances up or down dynamically based on demand.

SDN combines various technologies, including:
- The **Network Controller** allows you to automate the configuration of your network infrastructure.
- A **RAS-Gateway** is a software-based, multi-instance, BGP-enabled router to host multi-instance virtual networks using HNV.
- **Software load balancing** (SLB) is used in SDN to distribute the network traffic of the client and the client customer evenly across the virtual network resources.
