Microsoft is developing a new member of its **Azure Stack** hybrid computing family that is codenamed Azure Stack "Fiji." 
Fiji is meant to provide users with the ability to run **Azure** as a "local cloud", managed by public Azure and delivered in the form of racks of servers provided by Microsoft directly to users, according to my contacts.

Microsoft's goal with **Azure Stack Fiji** is also focused around providing users with low-latency capacity that is fully managed via the Azure fabric [most likely via Azure Arc] and using the same hardware infrastructure that Microsoft uses to run Azure. 
Azure Stack Hub, the current centerpiece of the company's hybrid-computing play, is provided as an appliance preloaded on certified server hardware from a a handful of Microsoft partners.

Microsoft's current hybrid-computing line-up includes: 
- **Azure Stack Hub**, its "Azure-consistent private cloud",
- **Azure Stack Edge**, its cloud-managed appliance; 
- **Azure Stack HCI** (Hyperconverged Infrastructure), its hyperconverged solution and
- **Azure Edge Zones**, its ultra-low-latency cloud solution

More in the future.
