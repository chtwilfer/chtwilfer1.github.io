A **Cloud Center of Excellence** (CCoE) is used to bring a diverse and knowledgeable group of experts from across the organization together to develop cloud best practices for the rest of the organization to follow. The CCoE has a support function to increase productivity throughout the organization and at the same time maintain a consistent and secure cloud platform. It is based on Microsoft agile practices and a delivery model that provides a programmatic approach to implement, manage, and operate the Microsoft Azure platform for onboarding projects and Azure workloads effectively.

A CCoE model, requires collaboration between:

- Cloud adoption
- Cloud strategy
- Cloud governance
- Cloud platform
- Cloud automation

When these aspects are addressed, the participants can accelerate innovation and migration while reducing the overall costs of change and increasing business agility. When implemented successfully, a CCoE will create a significant cultural shift in IT as well. Without the CCoE model, IT tends to focus on providing control and central responsibility. A successful CCoE model provides focus on freedom and delegated responsibility. This works best in a technology strategy with a self-service model that allows business units to make their own decisions. The CCoE provides a set of guidelines and established and repeatable controls, used by the business.

**Key responsibilities of a Cloud Center of Excellence**
The primary goal of the CCoE team is to accelerate cloud adoption through cloud native and hybrid solutions. The CCoE has the following objectives:

- Build a modern IT organization by capturing and implementing business requirements using agile approaches
- Build reusable deployment packages that fully align with security, compliance, and service management policies
- Maintain a functional Azure platform in alignment with operational procedures
- Review and approve the use of cloud-native tools
- Over time, standardize and automate commonly needed platform components and solutions

**The Cloud Center of Excellence team**
The CCoE team ideally consists of 3â€“5 people with a variety of IT backgrounds. This will bring a broad perspective and balanced set of knowledge. It should ideally include people who already have cloud experience and day-to-day roles, such as:

- IT/Operations/IT financial manager
- Solution/Infrastructure Architect
- Application developer
- Network engineer
- Database administrator
- Systems administrator

Excellent way to start your cloud journey. The Cloud Center of Excellence is an ideal model to accelerate your cloud adoption program.
